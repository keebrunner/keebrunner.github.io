# Through Shadows to the Light

This is the genesis of my personal career blog. My name is Gene Markin. While this may not resemble a conventional career launch, devoid as it is of a pending job offer and burdened by material, social, and psychological complexities, it marks a point of profound personal significance. On this day, which holds a particular resonance for me, I choose to embrace the intertwined threads of fate and free will, knowing that one day I will revisit these words with the clarity afforded by time and experience.

For 37 years, I have navigated the dark labyrinths of Tantalus, striving for the elusive solace of inner harmony. And now, after these arduous trials, I can finally declare: I'm ready to start my personal odyssey. A pivotal catalyst in this transformation has been a recent study conducted at The Alberta Children's Hospital in Canada, entitled "Executive functioning, ADHD symptoms and resting state functional connectivity in children with perinatal stroke." This exploration of the intricate connection between cerebral palsy and ADHD has provided a fresh perspective on these challenges, giving me the missing piece of the puzzle and allowing me to connect my own experiences with their findings and everything I had learned before.

I also owe a debt of gratitude to the enlightening podcasts of Dr. Andrew Huberman about neurophysiology, the audacious spirit of chemist Dr. Leroy Cronin, the non-dualistic insights into the human psyche offered by Dr. Sam Harris, and the boundless intellectual landscape of the world wide web.

Yes, I live with left-sided hemiparesis, a lasting effect of a perinatal stroke in the parietal region. This stroke not only resulted in cerebral palsy but also, it seems, a significant manifestation of ADHD. Beyond these, I face a multitude of other neurophysiological and psychological challenges. Yet, alongside these challenges, I nurture ambitious dreams. Let us see what the unfolding tapestry of life reveals. <span class="font-bold italic text-xl"><em>Per aspera ad astra.</em></p>
