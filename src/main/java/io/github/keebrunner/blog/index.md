## MY HARDWARE ADHD BRAIN JOURNEY


This blog is a personal exploration of my journey navigating the effects of neurodiversity, specifically ADHD, stemming from cerebral palsy due to a perinatal stroke. The stroke affected the parietal lobe of my brain, which is responsible for spatial reasoning, emotional intelligence, decision-making, and task-switching. Despite these challenges, I am determined to build a career in the fascinating field of bioinformatics.

This blog will serve as a chronicle of my experiences, insights, and learnings as I strive to overcome obstacles, develop new skills, and ultimately achieve my professional goals. I hope that by sharing my story, I can inspire others with neurodiversity, particularly those with ADHD, and provide valuable perspectives on the specifics of how brain networks function differently in individuals with neurodiversity.

P.S.  Truth be told, this blog is a lifeline against loneliness.
